1 
00:00:0,000 --> 00:00:4,000 
 This morning I wake up and I look in the mirror 

2 
00:00:4,000 --> 00:00:8,000 
 Every part of my body was in the place many people lie 

3 
00:00:8,000 --> 00:00:11,000 
 I don't wanna act too high and mighty 

4 
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000 
 Cause tomorrow I may fall down on my face 

5 
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000 
 Lord I thank You for sunshine 

6 
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000 
 Thank You for rain 

7 
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000 
 Thank You for joy 

8 
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000 
 Thank You for pain 

9 
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000 
 It's a beautiful day 

10 
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000 
 It's a beautiful day
