1. **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python 3.6 or later installed on your machine. You can download it from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Set up a virtual environment**: This helps to keep the dependencies used by different projects separate by creating isolated Python environments for them. You can create a virtual environment using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
source env/bin/activate

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements
